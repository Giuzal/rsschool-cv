#### Briefly About Myself:

I used to love math since school. As a graduate I was in the top 50 best scored of the state math exam among all graduates in the country.

I am not affraid of hard tasks and adore to solve problems.

I also have great soft skills, I am a team player, I am not affraid to ask questions.

I am good in self education and self discipline.

Programming always seemd like a magic for me. In the modern world everything can be automated.

I belive people can do great wonderful things with a computer science. And *I want to be a part of this process.*
